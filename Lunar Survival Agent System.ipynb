    "        ## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "        The evaluation followed a structured collaborative process:\n",

    "        1. **Knowledge Acquisition Phase**: Science and Resource analysts gathered environmental and survival knowledge\n",

    "        3. **Practical Reasoning Phase**: Resource and Creative reasoners evaluated items from a practical perspective\n",
    "        4. **Cross-Team Integration**: Team representatives reconciled perspectives and addressed disagreements\n",
    "        5. **Meta Reasoning**: A holistic analysis integrated all perspectives into final rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## Key Findings\n",
