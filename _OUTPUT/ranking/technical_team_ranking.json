  {
    "rank": 7,
    "name": "50 feet of nylon rope",
    "justification": "Useful for climbing, securing equipment, and traversing rough terrain. Its lightweight and durable nature makes it particularly valuable in the Moon\u2019s low-gravity environment.",

    "rank": 12,
    "name": "Two .45 caliber pistols",
    "justification": "Firearms can discharge in a vacuum but have minimal practical use. They might be used for mechanical tasks or signaling vibrations, but these are secondary considerations.",

  {
    "rank": 13,
    "name": "One case of dehydrated milk",
    "justification": "Provides nutrition but requires water for rehydration, making it less efficient than food concentrate.",

  },
  {
    "rank": 14,
    "name": "Magnetic compass",
    "justification": "Ineffective on the Moon due to the lack of a global magnetic field. Stellar maps are far more reliable for navigation.",
