    "rank": 6,
    "name": "Stellar map",
    "justification": "- **Justification**: Navigation is critical for reaching the rendezvous point. The stellar map allows the crew to orient themselves using lunar landmarks and celestial objects, compensating for the lack of GPS or magnetic fields.",

  {
    "rank": 9,
    "name": "Portable heating unit",
    "justification": "- **Justification**: Important for maintaining survivable body temperatures in shaded or colder areas, such as craters. Less critical during the lunar day but situationally important for thermal regulation.",

  {
    "rank": 10,
    "name": "Signal flares",
    "justification": "- **Justification**: While ineffective for combustion in the lunar vacuum, signal flares can be repurposed as visual markers or reflectors for signaling the mother ship or marking progress along the route.",

  {
    "rank": 12,
    "name": "Two .45 caliber pistols",
    "justification": "- **Justification**: Firearms can discharge in a vacuum but have minimal practical use. Could be used for mechanical tasks or signaling via vibrations, but their weight and limited utility make them impractical for the journey.",
    "confidence": 8

  {
    "rank": 13,
    "name": "One case of dehydrated milk",
    "justification": "- **Justification**: Provides nutrition but requires water for rehydration, which is a limited resource. Less efficient than food concentrate and bulky to carry.",

  },
  {
    "rank": 14,
    "name": "Magnetic compass",
    "justification": "- **Justification**: Ineffective on the Moon due to the lack of a global magnetic field. Stellar maps are far more reliable for navigation.",
