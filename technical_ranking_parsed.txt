Critical items like oxygen, water, and temperature regulation systems are indispensable for immediate survival and the 200-mile journey to the rendezvous point. Secondary items, such as stellar maps and nylon rope, provide additional utility but are not essential. Non-functional items, such as matches and firearms, are excluded due to their incompatibility with the lunar environment. This ranking ensures that survival priorities are mission-focused and reflect the unique challenges of the Moon.
