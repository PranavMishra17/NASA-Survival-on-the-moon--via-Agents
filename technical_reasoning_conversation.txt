- **Rank:** 13  
- **Technical Justification:** Designed for water-based environments, which are absent on the Moon. Inflation mechanisms relying on atmospheric pressure will not work in a vacuum.  
- **Confidence Score:** 10  
- **Team Consensus:** Fully agree. Life rafts are non-functional and irrelevant for lunar missions.

#### **14. Two .45 Caliber Pistols**  
- **Rank:** 14  
- **Technical Justification:** Firearms rely on atmospheric oxygen for combustion and cannot fire in a vacuum. They have no survival utility and pose unnecessary safety risks.  
- **Confidence Score:** 10  
- **Team Consensus:** Fully agree. Firearms are non-functional and irrelevant for lunar missions.

#### **15. Box of Matches**  
- **Rank:** 15  
- **Technical Justification:** Matches require atmospheric oxygen for combustion and are entirely non-functional in the Moon’s vacuum. They have no utility in this environment.  
- **Confidence Score:** 10  
- **Team Consensus:** Fully agree. Matches are non-functional and irrelevant for survival.

### **Conclusion**  

This **final collaborative ranking** represents a scientifically grounded and protocol-compliant survival strategy. Critical items like oxygen, water, and temperature regulation systems are indispensable for immediate survival and the 200-mile journey to the rendezvous point. Secondary items, such as stellar maps and nylon rope, provide additional utility but are not essential. Non-functional items, such as matches and firearms, are excluded due to their incompatibility with the lunar environment. This ranking ensures that survival priorities are mission-focused and reflect the unique challenges of the Moon.
