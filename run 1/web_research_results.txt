  - Nighttime temperatures can drop below **-173°C (-280°F)**.
- A lunar day lasts about **14 Earth days**, followed by a lunar night of equal length, causing prolonged exposure to extreme heat or cold.

#### **Radiation Exposure**
- The Moon lacks a magnetic field and atmosphere, leaving its surface exposed to:
  - **Solar radiation (solar wind)**.
  - **Cosmic rays** from deep space.
  - Periodic solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can significantly increase radiation levels.
