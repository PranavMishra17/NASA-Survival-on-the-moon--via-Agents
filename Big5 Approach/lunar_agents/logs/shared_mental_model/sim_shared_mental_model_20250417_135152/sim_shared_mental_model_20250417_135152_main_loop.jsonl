While not a primary navigation tool, it could offer limited directional guidance based on local magnetism.\n\n---\n\n#### **12. One case of dehydrated milk**\nDehydrated milk provides additional nutritional value but is far less efficient than the food concentrate, with lower caloric density per weight. It would be a secondary food source during a survival situation.\n\n---\n\n#### **13. Two .45 caliber pistols**\nWeapons have little utility on the Moon with no predators and no atmosphere for ballistics. While they could assist in breaking or cutting objects or signaling distress in some scenarios, their weight is unjustified for their limited survival value.\n\n---\n\n#### **14. Life raft**\nA life raft is virtually useless on the Moon where there is no water or need for flotation. Its potential as storage, protection, or shelter is superseded by lighter, more efficient alternatives like parachute silk.\n\n---\n\n#### **15. Box of matches**\nMatches are entirely unusable on the Moon due to the lack of oxygen for combustion. They are dead weight and offer no survival utility in the lunar environment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Ranked List of Lunar Survival Items:\n1. Oxygen tanks  \n2. Water  \n3. Stellar map  \n4. Solar-powered FM receiver-transmitter  \n5. Food concentrate  \n6. Portable heating unit  \n7. First aid kit  \n8. 50 feet of nylon rope  \n9. Parachute silk  \n10. Signal flares  \n11. Magnetic compass  \n12. One case of dehydrated milk  \n13. Two .45 caliber pistols  \n14. Life raft  \n15.
